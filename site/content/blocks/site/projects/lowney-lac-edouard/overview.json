Midland reported in an April 27, 2023 news release that Hole MDLD0001, drilled by Rio Tinto, intersected an interval grading 1.07% Ni and 0.13% Cu over 0.78 metres, from 101.87 to 102.65 metres. Midland also reported that grab samples taken by prospectors in the Savane area in 1995 yielded historical values of 1.80% Ni and 0.20% Cu. Another grab sample from a sub-cropping boulder also yielded grades of 1.98% Ni and 0.46% Cu about 250 metres north of the Savane showing (Source: SIGEOM NTS sheet 31P07; GM55352). This may not be representative of the mineralisation of Lowney-Lac Edouard.",

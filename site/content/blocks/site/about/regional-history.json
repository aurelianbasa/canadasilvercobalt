      "text": "Historical record credits the railway with discovery of silver, almost by accident in 1903 by subcontractors laying the track. In fact, local legend prophesied silver many years earlier. Small scale production on Lake temiskaming near forts set up by French fur traders marked the earliest production in the area. The railway allowed exploration and development to scale. Once the first shipment of silver slabs reached the south, news quickly spread and an invasion of prospectors occurred almost overnight. In short order, the town of Cobalt emerged on bare rock in the middle of the mining area. The camp grew rapidly and by the January of 1906 there were 16 mines established all in various stages of operations.",

      "text": "Exploration continued to fan out from Cobalt leading to the discovery of silver in Casey and Harris Townships in 1906, then in South Lorrain Township in 1907, and in the Miller Lake, Gowganda Lake, Elk Lake, and Maple Mountain areas in 1908. This exploration also led to discoveries of other mining camps, including Larder Lake, 1906, Porcupine in 1909, Kirkland Lake in 1911, and Matachewan later on in 1916. Many who made their names in Cobalt continued on north and made great discoveries there, too.",
